# Implementation of facial recognition using KNN model

In this demo, we show the implementation of face_recognition package as well as OpenCV. We use a KNN model to recognize faces in a video stream.

##Installation 

- Clone the repo
- Install all dependencies `pip install requirements.txt`

##Usage
- Create a folder within `train/people` for each person you want to train the model with, add as many facial images for that person for the training. 

- Run `python main.py` Wait for the model to be trained, make sure that you have a webcam connected and Voil√†.
